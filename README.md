# InFrame

InFrame is a SwiftUI app that captures a **context selfie**: it shoots the scene with the back camera, snaps a selfie with the front camera, and automatically composites the two into a single photo saved to your library.

## Features
- **Camera** – Switches between rear and front cameras to capture the scene and your selfie, then saves the composite (and optionally the originals) to the photo library.
- **Gallery** – Shows previously captured context selfies in a grid. Tap any item for a full-screen preview or explicitly request photo-library access.
- **Settings** – Toggle whether the original scene and selfie photos should also be kept.
- **Advertisement** – Displays a Google AdMob banner at the bottom of the gallery and periodically shows a full-screen interstitial ad with an option to remove ads.

## Getting Started
### Requirements
- iOS 17 or later
