InFrame Privacy Policy

Effective date / Last updated: September 16, 2025

1. Introduction

InFrame ("App," "we," "us," or "our") lets you capture context selfies by pairing a scene photo with your reaction shot. This privacy policy explains what information we process, why, and the choices you have while using the current beta build.

2. Information We Process

| Data Type | How It Is Obtained | Purpose | Shared With Third Parties |
|-----------|--------------------|---------|---------------------------|
| Photos & Composites | Captured with the device camera or imported from your photo library | Create, display, edit, and share composite images | No. Stored on your device unless you export them using the iOS share sheet. |
| Precise Location (optional) | Collected when you grant Location permission and capture a photo | Attach a place name or rounded coordinates to your composites so you can remember where they were taken | No. Stored with the photo on device. You can disable location tagging in Settings. |
| App Preferences & Counters | Saved locally in Apple’s `UserDefaults` | Remember onboarding state, premium status, and the ad frequency counter for interstitial placement | No. Stored locally on device. |
| Advertising Data | Automatically collected by Google Mobile Ads SDK | Deliver banner and interstitial ads, measure performance, and comply with attribution frameworks (e.g., SKAdNetwork) | Yes. Sent to Google and its advertising partners; may be used for tracking across apps and websites. |


We do not collect crash logs, performance analytics, contact information, or purchase history beyond what Apple provides to you and us for transaction validation.

3. Legal Basis (GDPR)

For users in the European Economic Area (EEA) or UK, we rely on:

Consent for optional location tagging and for advertising identifiers (IDFA).

Legitimate interests for essential local storage of preferences and entitlement flags.

4. Third-Party Services

Google Mobile Ads (AdMob). Provides banner and interstitial ads. Google may collect device identifiers (including the IDFA if you grant tracking permission), IP address, coarse or precise location, and ad-interaction data. Data may be transferred internationally under Google’s Standard Contractual Clauses. Google’s policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy
.

Apple StoreKit & App Store. Handles in-app purchases and may collect limited purchase and diagnostics data per Apple’s privacy policy.

5. Your Rights & Choices

Permissions. Revoke camera, photo library, or location access in iOS Settings at any time.

Tracking & Ads. You can deny App Tracking Transparency prompts. We request Google’s “limited ads mode” when tracking is declined.

Access / Deletion Requests. If you reside in the EEA, UK, or California, you may request access to or deletion of any personal data we control (typically only purchase records and ad identifiers). Email us as described in Section 10.

Do Not Sell or Share (CCPA/CPRA). We do not sell personal information or share it for cross-context behavioral advertising.

6. Data Retention

Photos, composites, and metadata remain on your device until you delete them or uninstall the App.

Preferences and entitlement flags persist until you reset or delete the App.

StoreKit purchase records remain with Apple subject to their retention schedules.

7. Security

All communication with Apple and Google uses encrypted HTTPS/TLS. Because most data stays on your device, we do not add additional encryption layers.

8. Children

The App is not directed to children under 13 or the digital-consent age in your jurisdiction. If you believe a child has used the App and interacted with ads, contact us and we will work with Google to address the issue.

9. International Users

Information processed by Google or Apple may be transferred and stored in countries outside your own, including the United States. These transfers use appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses.

10. Changes

We may update this policy as features evolve. Significant changes will be announced within the App or via TestFlight notes, and the “Last updated” date will change.
