# InFrame Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** September 18, 2025

## 1. Introduction
InFrame (the "App") is a mobile photography experience created and operated by Wayman Design / 3D Light ("Wayman Design," "we," "us," or "our"). The App lets you capture a scene with the rear camera, take a selfie with the front camera, and automatically combine the two into a single composite image. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle personal data when you use InFrame.

Wayman Design / 3D Light is the data controller for the personal data processed through the App for users in the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland. You can contact us at **3dlight.mail@gmail.com** with any privacy questions or to exercise your rights.

This Privacy Policy applies to all users worldwide. Certain sections highlight additional rights that apply specifically to residents of the EEA/UK (under the GDPR/UK GDPR) and California (under the CCPA/CPRA).

## 2. Data We Collect and How We Use It
We strive to keep the data we handle to a minimum. The table below summarizes the data categories, the specific elements involved, why we process them, where they are stored, and the third parties that help us provide the App.

| Data Category | Data Elements | Source | Purpose of Processing | Stored on Device or Transmitted? | Third-Party Recipients & Processing Locations |
|---------------|---------------|--------|------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Scene Photos, Selfies & Composites | Photos you capture with the rear and front cameras, optional originals saved to the Photos app, generated composite images, timestamps | Device cameras and your photo library | Provide core functionality: capture, edit, preview, and export composite images you request | Stored locally on your device. Only transmitted when you choose to share or back up via Apple services or other apps | None. If you share externally, the recipient app or service becomes a separate controller |
| Optional Location Tags | Approximate or precise location metadata attached to a photo, associated place name | Device sensors (GPS, Wi-Fi) when you grant location permission | Let you organize and remember where a composite was created, display location captions | Stored locally within the photo metadata. Not transmitted unless you share the image | None by default |
| App Preferences & Entitlements | In-app settings (e.g., whether to save originals), onboarding state, ad frequency counter, subscription/upgrade status | Your in-app selections and Apple StoreKit responses | Remember your choices, determine whether to display ads, apply ad-free upgrades | Stored locally using Apple’s secure sandbox (UserDefaults, Keychain). Not transmitted to our servers | None |
| Purchase & Subscription Records | Transaction identifiers, product identifiers, purchase date, subscription status, refunds | Apple StoreKit and App Store receipts | Validate purchases, enable premium features, handle support requests, meet accounting and legal obligations | Stored on your device and within Apple’s systems. May be temporarily processed by Wayman Design when you contact support | Apple (United States, EU, and other regions where Apple operates App Store infrastructure); payment details remain with Apple |
| Advertising Identifiers & Event Data (optional) | Advertising ID (IDFA, if you grant tracking permission), device information, IP address, app interaction events, ad impressions/clicks | Automatically collected by the Google Mobile Ads SDK | Deliver ads, limit frequency, measure performance, detect fraud, comply with Apple’s SKAdNetwork | Transmitted securely to Google’s AdMob servers. Not stored by Wayman Design | Google LLC and its affiliated advertising partners (may process data in the United States, EU/EEA, and other countries where Google has facilities) |
| Diagnostics & Error Logs (optional) | Crash reports, performance metrics, device model, OS version | Apple if you opt in to share crash reports, or Google if aggregated diagnostics are enabled | Maintain and improve stability, investigate and resolve issues | Stored locally and transmitted to Apple and/or Google subject to your opt-in choices. Accessed by Wayman Design only in aggregated form | Apple Inc. (global infrastructure) and Google LLC (global infrastructure) |

We do **not** intentionally collect contact lists, account passwords, or the contents of personal communications. We do not sell or share your personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising.

## 3. Legal Bases for Processing (EEA/UK)
Where the GDPR or UK GDPR applies, we rely on the following legal bases:

| Data Category | Legal Basis |
|---------------|-------------|
| Scene Photos, Selfies & Composites | Performance of a contract (necessary to provide the requested features) |
| Optional Location Tags | Your consent, which you can withdraw at any time in iOS Settings or within the App |
| App Preferences & Entitlements | Our legitimate interests in providing a consistent user experience and preventing fraud |
| Purchase & Subscription Records | Performance of a contract and compliance with legal obligations (tax and accounting requirements) |
| Advertising Identifiers & Event Data | Your consent for personalized advertising; our legitimate interests for non-personalized, contextual advertising and frequency capping |
| Diagnostics & Error Logs | Our legitimate interests in maintaining and improving the App, subject to any consent you provide through Apple or Google |

If we need to process your personal data for a new purpose, we will update this Privacy Policy and, where required, request your consent.

## 4. Use of Third Parties and International Transfers
We work with carefully selected service providers to support the App:

- **Apple Inc. (StoreKit, App Store, iCloud Photos, device services).** Handles purchases, in-app entitlements, and optional photo syncing or backups you initiate. Apple may process your data in the United States or other regions where it operates.
- **Google LLC (Google Mobile Ads / AdMob).** Provides banner and interstitial advertising, fraud prevention, and aggregated performance metrics. Google stores and processes data on servers located worldwide.

When data leaves your home country, it may be processed in countries that do not provide the same level of data protection as your jurisdiction. Where the GDPR requires it, we rely on European Commission Standard Contractual Clauses, Apple’s and Google’s published Data Processing Agreements, and other safeguards to protect personal data transferred outside the EEA/UK.

We do not permit our processors to use your personal information for their own independent purposes, and we require them to safeguard your data consistent with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.

## 5. Cookies, SDKs, and Tracking Technologies
InFrame does not set cookies within the App. However, embedded SDKs may use similar technologies:

- **Google Mobile Ads SDK** may store identifiers on your device and access Apple’s Advertising Identifier (IDFA) with your permission. This enables ad delivery, personalization (if you consent), and measurement.
- **Apple App Tracking Transparency (ATT)** prompts you to grant or deny tracking permission. If you decline, Google AdMob is instructed to show non-personalized ads and restricts data use accordingly.
- You can reset or limit ad tracking by visiting **Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking** on iOS, or enable Limit Ad Tracking. You can also disable personalized ads within the App’s settings where available.

## 6. Data Retention
We retain data only as long as needed for the purposes described above:

- **Photos, composites, and optional location metadata** remain on your device until you delete them or uninstall the App. Items moved to the system Photos Trash follow Apple’s retention schedule (typically 30 days).
- **App preferences and entitlements** remain until you reset the App or delete it. If you reinstall the App on the same Apple ID, StoreKit may restore prior purchases.
- **Purchase and subscription records** are retained for the duration of your subscription or entitlement plus up to seven (7) years to meet accounting, audit, and legal requirements.
- **Advertising identifiers and event data** are retained by Google for the shorter of thirteen (13) months or the period required to fulfill the purposes described above, after which data is aggregated or deleted according to Google’s policies.
- **Diagnostics and error logs** provided by Apple or Google are stored for up to twenty-four (24) months, unless a shorter period is required by those services.

When data is no longer needed, it is deleted or anonymized.

## 7. Your Rights and Choices
### Rights for EEA/UK Users
If you are located in the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, you have the right to:

- Request access to the personal data we hold about you.
- Request correction (rectification) of inaccurate or incomplete data.
- Request deletion (erasure) of your personal data.
- Request that we restrict the processing of your personal data.
- Object to processing carried out on the basis of legitimate interests or direct marketing.
- Request data portability in a commonly used, machine-readable format.
- Withdraw your consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing before withdrawal.

To exercise these rights, email **privacy@waymandesign.com** with your request and the country you reside in. We may need to verify your identity before responding. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority. For example, users in the Netherlands may contact the Dutch Data Protection Authority (Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens) at <https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/>.

### Rights for California Residents
If you are a California resident, you have the right to:

- Know the categories and specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.
- Request deletion of personal information, subject to certain exceptions (for example, when required to complete a transaction or comply with law).
- Correct inaccurate personal information.
- Opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising (we do not sell or share personal information in this way).
- Limit the use and disclosure of sensitive personal information (we only process sensitive data, such as precise location, with your consent and to provide the requested service).
- Not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising your privacy rights.

To submit a request, email **privacy@waymandesign.com** and indicate you are a California resident. If you submit a deletion request, you can also delete local data directly by removing it within the App or uninstalling the App. We will verify your identity using information associated with your Apple ID or recent App activity. Authorized agents may submit requests on your behalf when accompanied by written authorization.

### Other Choices Available to All Users
- **Permissions:** You can change camera, microphone, photo library, or location permissions at any time in **Settings > Privacy & Security** on your device. Some features will be unavailable without these permissions.
- **Ad Preferences:** Use in-app settings or iOS Tracking controls to disable personalized advertising. We will continue to show contextual ads unless you purchase the ad-free upgrade.
- **Data Deletion:** Delete photos and composites within the App or Photos app, or uninstall the App to remove local data.

## 8. Children’s Privacy
InFrame is not directed to children under 13, or under 16 in jurisdictions where a higher age threshold applies. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If we learn that a child has provided personal data through the App, we will delete the data or take steps to obtain verifiable parental consent. Parents or guardians who believe their child has used the App without authorization should contact us at **privacy@waymandesign.com**.

## 9. Security Measures
We implement technical and organizational measures to protect personal data:

- All network communications with Apple and Google services occur over encrypted channels (HTTPS/TLS).
- Photos and preferences are stored within the iOS sandbox, benefiting from Apple’s device-level encryption and biometric protections when enabled.
- Access to any personal data handled off-device (such as purchase confirmations or aggregated diagnostics) is restricted to authorized personnel who require it for their role.
- We maintain procedures to assess and respond to potential data incidents. If a data breach occurs that is likely to result in a risk to your rights and freedoms, we will notify affected users and relevant authorities as required by law.

## 10. Automated Decision-Making and Profiling
We do not use automated decision-making or profiling that produces legal or similarly significant effects on you. Advertising placements provided by Google rely on your consent and standard ad-serving logic, not solely automated decisions made by Wayman Design.

## 11. Mandatory vs. Optional Data
Certain data is necessary to use core App features:

- **Mandatory:** Camera access is required to capture scene and selfie photos. Saving composites requires access to your photo library. Basic device information may be processed to ensure the App functions properly and to prevent fraud.
- **Optional:** Location tagging, personalized ads, diagnostics sharing, and purchasing the ad-free upgrade are optional. If you decline optional permissions, certain features (such as location captions or personalized ads) will not be available, but the core photo experience will remain usable.

## 12. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy as the App evolves or to comply with new legal requirements. When we make material changes, we will:

1. Update the "Last updated" date at the top of this document; and
2. Provide notice within the App (for example, through an in-app message or TestFlight release notes) or via the App Store listing before the changes take effect when required.

If you continue to use the App after the updated policy becomes effective, you acknowledge the revised terms. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly.
