# InFrame Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** September 16, 2025

## 1. Introduction
InFrame ("App," "we," "us," or "our") lets you capture context selfies by pairing a scene photo with your reaction shot. This privacy policy explains what information the App touches, how it is used, and what choices you have while using the current beta build.

## 2. Information We Process

| Data Type | How It Is Obtained | Purpose | Shared With Third Parties |
|-----------|--------------------|---------|---------------------------|
| Photos & Composites | Captured with the device camera or imported from your photo library | Create, display, edit, and share composite images | No. Stored on your device unless you export them using the iOS share sheet. |
| Precise Location (optional) | Collected when you grant Location permission and capture a photo | Attach a place name or rounded coordinates to your composites so you can remember where they were taken | No. Stored with the photo on device. You can disable location tagging in Settings. |
| App Preferences & Counters | Saved locally in Apple’s `UserDefaults` | Remember onboarding state, premium status, and the ad frequency counter for interstitial placement | No. Stored locally on device. |
| Advertising Data | Automatically collected by Google Mobile Ads SDK | Deliver banner and interstitial ads, measure performance, and comply with attribution frameworks (e.g., SKAdNetwork) | Yes. Sent to Google and its advertising partners; may be used for tracking across apps and websites. |

We do **not** collect crash logs, performance analytics, contact information, or purchase history. StoreKit transactions are used only to update your local entitlement (for example, to remove ads) and are not transmitted to Google.

## 3. Third-Party Services
- **Google Mobile Ads (AdMob).** Provides banner and interstitial ads. Google may collect device identifiers (including the IDFA if you grant tracking permission), approximate or precise location if available, and ad interaction data. Review Google’s privacy policy at <https://policies.google.com/privacy>.
- The App does not integrate additional analytics, social, or cloud-storage providers in this beta.

## 4. Your Choices
- **Permissions.** You can revoke camera, photo library, or location access in iOS Settings at any time. Some features will be limited without these permissions.
- **Tracking.** If prompted by Apple’s App Tracking Transparency dialog, you may decline tracking. We honor Apple’s choice and request Google’s limited ads mode where available.
- **Photo & Location Deletion.** Delete items from the Gallery or Trash to remove them. Deleting the App removes all locally stored content.
- **Do Not Sell or Share.** We do not sell personal information. If you are in a jurisdiction with specific privacy rights (for example, GDPR or CCPA), contact us to exercise access or deletion rights.

## 5. Data Retention
- Photos, composites, and metadata remain on your device until you delete them or uninstall the App.
- Items moved to the Trash are automatically purged after 30 days or sooner if you empty the Trash manually.
- Preferences and entitlement flags persist until you reset the App or delete it.

## 6. Security
All networking occurs through Apple’s and Google’s standard encrypted channels (HTTPS/TLS). Because data stays on your device, we do not add extra encryption layers beyond those platform safeguards.

## 7. Children
The App is not directed to children under 13 (or the age required by your jurisdiction). If you believe a child has used the App and interacted with ads, contact us and we will work with Google to address the issue.

## 8. Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy as features evolve. Significant changes will be announced within the App or via TestFlight notes, and the "Last updated" date will change.
